        This study is part of a fourth year, computer science student project, the main objective of which is to design and implement a fairly cheap EMG system for Android phone devices.\n
        The study will proceed in the following conditions:\n
        You will be placed 3 electrodes on the skin of your biceps.
        These electrodes will be connected to two EMG systems, one at a time - a professional one and the one proposed by this project.\n
        The recorded data from them will be used to see the muscle activity of your biceps under certain conditions.\n
        To do that, you will be asked to hold different weights and flex your muscle using proper technique for each weight.
        You will hold a flexed position for a short period of time and then relax the muscle.\n
        After the two systems have been successfully used, the electrodes will be removed from your skin.\n
        The electrical signals from your muscle will be recorded to a file in order to compare the two  systems.\n
        To proceed with the study, please agree to the terms and conditions above.
